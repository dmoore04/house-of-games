# House of Games React Web App üè†

## Overview

House of Games is an interactive board game review web app. It dynamically pulls and renders data from a dedicated [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database using requests to its [Back-End API](https://github.com/dmoore04/house-of-games-API). Users are able to browse, talk about and vote on reviews posted by others.

</br>

The app is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and implements [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) to deliver a responsive single-page application (SPA). Our data fetching was handled by the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) HTTP library. The majority of the sites styling was implemented using [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). [Google's Material UI](https://mui.com/) (MUI) was used in places to animate component transitions.
